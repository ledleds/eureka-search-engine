## Eureka Search Engine!

Final project (weeks 11 & 12) at Makers Academy. Tasked with working on a project of our design in languages and testing frameworks of our choice.

Central throughout the project were TDD/BDD, XP values and agile practices.

## Epic User Stories

```
As a user of the web,
So that I can find interesting webpages,
I want to be able to search with multiple words.

## Challenges

- Working in Node's asynchronous environment was challenging for the requirements of this project. We used Promises to halt execution of subsequent functions before the necessary information had been retrieved by pg promises from the PostgreSQL database.
